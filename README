INTRODUCTION

  Here is the protoype version of dennis, an automated DNS builder/maintainer.
  Right now it builds for a BIND 8 DNS master and BIND 4 slaves. That will
  change to allow a mixture of BIND 4 or 8 masters and slaves later. The zone
  files are built from an /etc/hosts style file. This could potentially expand
  to reading the data from an LDAP or SQL database later. A syntax checker is
  also included. It should catch duplicate IPs and other bogus entries. The
  format for the lookup files built is one file for the forward lookup and
  multiple for the reverse which depend on the first three octets of an IP.
  There is some built intelligence where dennis will figure out if zone files
  have changed (this can happen the first time you add an IP where a zone file
  for it does not already exist) and optionally mail hostmaster.

  It is not a finished piece of work and should not be considered as such. It
  also assumes that you know a fair amount about BIND already, it is not meant to
  teach you how use BIND, rather than to automate what is a mostly repetitive
  task that might be prone to errors.

  The scripts should be setuid safe and you can choose to either make dennis
  setuid or just run it as root depending on your site security policy. If you
  discover any problems, please tell me.

REQUIREMENTS
  
  perl
	You can decide if you want the program to be setuid. But all scripts
	are setuid safe up to the latest version of perl i.e. they pass
	perl5.004_04's taint-checking.

  bind
  	As of now, you need to be running bind 8 on your master nameserver. I
	will resurrect the code to output bind 4 info as an option probably in
	a later release.

  RCS
  	This is for putting the hosts file under revision control.
