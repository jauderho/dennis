INTRODUCTION

  Here is the protoype version of dennis, an automated DNS builder/maintainer.
  Right now it builds for a BIND 8 DNS master and BIND 4 slaves. That will
  change to allow a mixture of BIND 4 or 8 masters and slaves later. The zone
  files are built from an /etc/hosts style file. This could potentially expand
  to reading the data from an LDAP or SQL database later. A syntax checker is
  also included. It should catch duplicate IPs and other bogus entries.

  This software is currently in use at KLA-Tencor and additional testing has
  been done at Transmeta Corporation. It is not a finished piece of work and
  should not be considered as such. It also assumes that you know a fair amount
  about BIND already, it is not meant to teach you how use BIND, rather than to
  automate what is a mostly repetitive task that might be prone to errors.

  The scripts should be setuid safe and you can choose to either make editDNS
  setuid or just run it as root depending on your site security policy. If you
  discover any problems, please tell me.

MOTIVATION

  Frankly, I got tired of updating DNS by hand all the time. There were lots of
  times where I would update the forward lookup and forget the reverse. Silly
  things like forgetting to increment the serial number just add to needless
  pain. While I was at KLA-Tencor, there was this old antiquted shell script
  that took 10-15 mins to rebuild the DNS every time. This is the rewrite. What
  used to take 10-15mins to build now takes 30s tops. It has been tested on a
  host table that has ~4500 entries and should have no real problems scaling.

AVAILABILITY

MISC

  Why is this called dennis?
	Well DNS sounds like dennis if you sort of slur it so I decided to call
	it that for lack of a better name.
