- Lots.

- As of now I am not even sure if it will even work out the box. I am hoping
  that by releasing this sooner than later, that I will be able to get it
  usable again.

- Well, it seems that at least some people have been able to get this stuff
  working so that's a good sign.

- Documentation. I need to document most of this stuff. The code is pretty
  well commented but there needs to be documentation that describes what does 
  what.

- Have dennisBuild grok stuff after # and use it as TXT records

- I will probably move to using an SQL database and/or LDAP to create the host
  entries. /etc/hosts style files do have their limitations. 

- More speed would be nicer although it is currently plenty fast. I suspect
  most time is actually spent reading data in. Benchmarking required.

- Additional support for creating various kind of zone files such as secondary
  bind 8 format files. 

- Ability to set levels of paranoia for dnsVerify.

- <Your suggestion/wishlist here>
