# Refactoring Notes for Dennis DNS Management Suite

## Overview of Changes

This document outlines the significant refactoring efforts applied to the Dennis DNS management scripts, primarily `dennisBuild.pl` (Perl script) and `dennis` (shell script wrapper). The goals were to modernize the scripts, improve security, remove outdated practices, and align with current BIND 9+ standards.

Key areas of refactoring included:
-   **Modern Perl Practices:** Applying `use strict; use warnings;`, using lexical filehandles, and adopting core Perl modules over external commands where possible.
-   **BIND Version Support:** Removing BIND 4 specific logic and ensuring generated configurations and zone files are compatible with BIND 9+.
-   **Security Enhancements:** Addressing Perl's taint mode, validating inputs, and replacing insecure system calls.
-   **Configuration Management:** Introducing a clearer way to manage configuration for `dennisBuild.pl` via `our` variables, intended to be populated from `etc/dennis.conf`.
-   **Code Clarity:** Improving comments and structure for better maintainability.

## `dennisBuild.pl` (Perl Script)

The `dennisBuild.pl` script, responsible for generating BIND zone files and configuration snippets from a hosts file, underwent substantial changes:

1.  **BIND 4 Support Removed:** All code specific to BIND 4, including the `$servertype` variable and `createBind4ZoneConf` subroutine, has been removed. The script now exclusively generates configurations suitable for BIND 8/9+ (effectively BIND 9+ due to modern practices).
2.  **`FileCache` Module Removed:** The dependency on and usage of the `FileCache` module were removed. File operations now use standard lexical filehandles, and zone file content is written directly.
3.  **Configuration via `our` Variables:**
    The script now expects several `our` package variables to be pre-defined with configuration settings. These are intended to be loaded from `etc/dennis.conf`. The required variables are:
    *   `our $dnshome`: Base directory for DNS operations (e.g., "/var/named").
    *   `our $domainName`: The primary domain being managed (e.g., "example.com").
    *   `our $fileSerial`: Path to the serial number file (e.g., "$dnshome/etc/serial").
    *   `our $fileHosts`: Path to the input hosts file (e.g., "$dnshome/etc/hosts").
    *   `our $fileNameServers`: Path to the file containing NS and MX records to append (e.g., "$dnshome/etc/nameservers").
    *   `our $fileForZone`: Path for the generated main forward zone file (e.g., "$dnshome/master/$domainName.zone").
    *   `our $serverName`: FQDN of the primary nameserver (e.g., "ns1.example.com.").
    *   `our $contactName`: Contact email for SOA RNAME (e.g., "hostmaster.example.com.").
    *   `our $date`: Path to the system `date` command (e.g., "/bin/date"), used for generating the YYYYMMDD portion of the serial.
4.  **Security Improvements:**
    *   **Taint Mode (`-T`):** The script operates under taint mode.
    *   **Input Validation:** Data read from the hosts file (IP addresses, hostnames, aliases) is now validated using regular expressions, and captured values are used to untaint the data. Invalid entries are logged as warnings and skipped.
    *   **Serial Date Validation:** The date obtained from the external `date` command for serial numbers is validated to be in YYYYMMDD format.
    *   **`File::Compare`:** The external `cmp` command, previously used for comparing zone configuration files, has been replaced with the core Perl module `File::Compare`.
    *   **Lexical Filehandles & 3-Argument Open:** All file operations use modern lexical filehandles and the 3-argument form of `open`.
    *   **`File::Spec`:** Used for constructing file paths portably.

## `dennis` (Shell Script)

The `dennis` shell script, which acts as a user-facing wrapper for editing the hosts file and triggering `dennisBuild.pl`, received the following updates:

1.  **`dnshome` Variable:** A comment was added to emphasize that the `dnshome` variable in this script must align with the `$dnshome` configuration used by `dennisBuild.pl` (i.e., from `etc/dennis.conf`).
2.  **`dennis.conf` Dependency:** A comment was added before calling `dennisBuild` to note its reliance on `etc/dennis.conf` for crucial configuration parameters.
3.  **Path Usage:** Confirmed that script calls (`dennisBuild`, `dnsVerify`, `createSecondary`) correctly rely on the `PATH` modification within the script, which includes `$dnshome/bin`.

## BIND Configuration Files (`etc/*.bind`, `etc/named.conf`)

A detailed review of the static BIND configuration files in `etc/` and `examples/` was performed.

**Current State:** The configuration files in the `etc/` directory (`acls.bind`, `logging.bind`, `options.bind`, `server.bind`, `zones-static.bind`, `named.conf`) were found to be **empty**. The legacy `etc/named.boot` file is also empty, which is good.

**Recommendations:**
The `etc/` files need to be populated based on the structures shown in their `examples/` counterparts, and then significantly updated to align with modern BIND 9+ best practices for security, logging, and features. A comprehensive set of recommendations was generated in a previous step. Key highlights include:

*   **`etc/named.conf`:** Use `include` statements as per the example to maintain a modular configuration.
*   **`etc/acls.bind`:** Define ACLs for trusted clients (`internal-clients`) to control recursion and query access.
*   **`etc/logging.bind`:** Implement detailed logging with multiple channels (default, queries, security) and categories.
*   **`etc/options.bind`:** This is critical. Configure:
    *   Core settings: `directory`, `pid-file`.
    *   Security: `allow-recursion { internal-clients; };`, `minimal-responses yes;`, `version "not recommended";`, `rate-limit`.
    *   Disable/restrict features not explicitly needed (e.g., forwarding on authoritative servers).
*   **`etc/zones-static.bind`:** Include hint zone (`.`) and localhost zones.
*   A full textual summary of these recommendations is available (as the output of Step 6 of the overall task). *[Self-correction: This refers to a previous subtask's output, which should be stored/referenced by the user of these notes.]*

## `etc/dennis.conf`

This Perl script file is now the designated way to provide configuration to `dennisBuild.pl`.

*   **Importance:** It defines all key paths and names that `dennisBuild.pl` uses for its operations. Correctly populating this file is crucial for `dennisBuild.pl` to function as expected.
*   **Template Created:** A template for `etc/dennis.conf` has been created. It includes all necessary `our` variable declarations with comments explaining each one and placeholders for site-specific values (e.g., `$domainName`, `$serverName`). Users **MUST** edit this template with their actual environment details.
*   **Alignment:** Values like `$dnshome` in this file *must* align with BIND's configuration (e.g., `directory` option) and the `dennis` shell script's `dnshome` variable.

## Testing Strategy (Outline)

A full test of the refactored system requires careful setup and verification.

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   **Populate `etc/dennis.conf`:** Edit the newly created `etc/dennis.conf` template with values appropriate for the test environment (domain name, server name, paths if different from defaults).
    *   **Populate BIND Static Configuration:** Create/update the static BIND configuration files in `etc/` (`named.conf`, `options.bind`, `acls.bind`, `logging.bind`, `zones-static.bind`) based on the detailed recommendations previously generated. Ensure essential zones like root hints (`.`) and localhost are defined.
    *   **Sample `etc/hosts`:** Create a small but representative `etc/hosts` file with various record types (A records, CNAMEs for aliases). Include valid and potentially a few intentionally malformed lines to test validation.
    *   **Sample `etc/nameservers`:** Create an `etc/nameservers` file with a few NS records and an MX record for the test domain.
    *   **BIND Installation:** A working BIND 9+ installation is required.
    *   **Perl Environment:** Ensure necessary Perl modules are available (though the refactored script aims to use core modules where possible).

2.  **Execution Steps:**
    *   **Run `dennis` script:** Execute the main `dennis` shell script.
    *   **Edit `etc/hosts`:** When `vi` opens `etc/hosts` (or manually edit it if `vi` is bypassed for testing), make some simple changes, save, and exit.
    *   **Allow `dennisBuild` to run:** When prompted by `dennis` script, choose to rebuild DNS tables. This will trigger `dennisBuild.pl` and `createSecondary`.
    *   Observe console output for any errors or warnings from `dnsVerify`, `dennisBuild.pl`, or `createSecondary`.

3.  **Verification Checks:**
    *   **Configuration Syntax:**
        *   `named-checkconf /var/named/etc/named.conf` (or the path to your main BIND config file). This should report no errors.
    *   **Zone File Syntax:**
        *   For each zone file generated by `dennisBuild.pl` in `$dnshome/master/` (e.g., `$dnshome/master/$domainName.zone` and reverse zone files like `$dnshome/master/1.2.10`):
            `named-checkzone your.domain.name /var/named/master/your.domain.name.zone`
            `named-checkzone 3.2.1.in-addr.arpa /var/named/master/1.2.3` (adjust for your test IPs)
        *   These should report `OK`.
    *   **BIND Service:**
        *   Attempt to start/restart the BIND service. Check system logs for any BIND startup errors.
    *   **DNS Queries (using `dig`):**
        *   Query for A records defined in `etc/hosts`.
        *   Query for CNAME records.
        *   Query for PTR records for the IPs.
        *   Query for NS and MX records (should come from `etc/nameservers` via `$fileForZone`).
        *   Query for SOA record.
        *   Verify serial number in SOA record matches what's expected from `$dnshome/etc/serial`.
        *   Test recursion for internal clients (if configured) and ensure it's denied for external/unauthorized clients.
    *   **Lock Files:** Verify `editDNS.lock` is created and removed correctly by the `dennis` script.
    *   **Log Files:** Check BIND's log files (as configured in `logging.bind`) for any unexpected errors or warnings.

This outline provides a basis for developing a comprehensive test plan. Each step would need detailed test cases for thorough validation.
