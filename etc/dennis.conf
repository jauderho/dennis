# Dennis Configuration File
#
# This file should be placed at /var/named/etc/dennis.conf (or the path
# configured in dennisBuild.pl if its internal default is modified, though
# dennisBuild.pl is now designed to have these 'our' variables set by this file
# if it were 'require'd, or populated by a wrapper script).
# It provides essential configuration variables for dennisBuild.pl.

use strict;

# POSIX qw(strftime) is not used by dennisBuild.pl for $date at the moment.
# dennisBuild.pl currently uses the external 'date' command for $serialdate,
# and the $date variable (used for backup naming in createBindZoneConf) is now also
# derived from the validated $serialdate (YYYYMMDD format) within dennisBuild.pl.

# Base directory for DNS operations. BIND's working directory is often set here.
# This path MUST align with the 'dnshome' variable in the 'dennis' shell script
# and BIND's 'directory' option in named.conf (typically in options.bind).
our $dnshome = "/var/named";

# The primary domain name this server is authoritative for (or manages).
# Used for constructing FQDNs and default zone names.

# Path to the file that stores the current serial number (YYYYMMDDnn format).
# dennisBuild.pl reads from and writes to this file.

# Path to the input hosts file that dennisBuild.pl processes.
# This file is typically edited manually or via the 'dennis' script.
our $fileHosts = "$dnshome/etc/hosts"; # Example: /var/named/etc/hosts

# Path to the file containing nameserver (NS) and mail exchanger (MX) records
# that will be appended to the main forward zone file ($fileForZone).
# Example content:
# IN NS ns1.example.com.
# IN NS ns2.example.com.
# example.com. IN MX 10 mail.example.com.
# *.example.com. IN MX 10 mail.example.com.
our $fileNameServers = "$dnshome/etc/nameservers"; # Example: /var/named/etc/nameservers

# Example: /var/named/master/example.com.zone if $fileForZone is "$dnshome/master/$domainName.zone"
# The value in dennisBuild.pl's placeholder is "$dnshome/master/$domainName.zone".
# Ensure this matches your intended structure and BIND configuration for this zone.

# Contact email address for the SOA RNAME field (replace '@' with '.', end with a dot).
# e.g., hostmaster.example.com.
our $contactName = "hostmaster.$domainName."; # !!! CHANGE THIS if your contact email is different !!!

# Path to the 'date' executable. Used by dennisBuild.pl to generate the base $serialdate (YYYYMMDD).
# The $date variable for backup naming in dennisBuild.pl's createBindZoneConf is now
# directly using the validated $serialdate.
