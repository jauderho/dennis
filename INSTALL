INSTALLATION

  First of all, untar it and copy the directory's entire contents to wherever
  that you want to install it. I haven't had time to write an installation
  script yet. Voluteers wanted.

  There are example configs in examples/, do copy them over into etc/. I have
  left empty files in etc/ indicating where things should go. If you choose
  to have the DNS master be BIND 4, please make a soft link from /etc/named.boot
  to <path where you installed dennis>/etc/named.boot for it to work 
  automatically. Else if you are using BIND 8, copy the file named named.conf
  from the examples directory to the etc directory; edit it to suit you and
  make the appropriate soft link from /etc/named.conf to the right place.

  To get started put an /etc/hosts style file called hosts in etc/ and run
  dennis.
