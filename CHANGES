0.06alpha
	This is pre alpha software and hence this is just a placeholder till
	I get some time to clean all of this stuff up. 

0.07alpha
	Initial release of the software to the world. Hope at least some of 
	this stuff works!

0.08alpha
	Changed the way dennis.conf is laid out. There's now an option to 
	output either bind4 or bind8 zone files for both master and
	secondaries. You can only choose to output bind4 or bind8 for the 
	master but you can output to either or both for the secondaries.

0.09alpha
	Added a whole slew of new tools designed to help make the migration
	process a little easier. Look in tools/ for the scripts.
